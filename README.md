# BooksON

● Developed as a ecommerce web application.
● Architected using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, PHP, MySQL, Stripe API.
● Designed a relational database for this project.
● Allows user to view/purchase books online, filter books by category, search books, add comments on books
and contact admin for any questions or feedbacks.
● Implemented payment method using Stripe API. Using Stripe API, implemented credit/debit card validation
and submit the card data to Stripe and retrieved a unique customer id. Instead of storing sensitive credit card details into database, stored the unique customer id into the database. Next time customer can be charged using solely the customer id without the need of credit card details.
